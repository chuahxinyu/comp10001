## âœ¨ About Tutorials
* Try to come to tutorials regardless of whether or not you've watched lectures
* I basically cloned each week's tute sheet into a Google Colab so yall can fill it up with answers, take down notes and write code all on the same document for easy reference in the future
* the Google Colab link for each week will be in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chuahxinyu/comp10001) by Sunday each week and Slides (with answers) will be uploaded by the end of Wednesday's tutorial (1pm)
* ðŸ™‹ be sure to ask questions before/during/after class - my email: chuaxc@unimelb.edu.au
